    train_set - List of list of words corresponding with each movie review
    example: suppose I had two reviews 'like this movie' and 'i fall asleep' in my training set
    Then train_set := [['like','this','movie'], ['i','fall','asleep']]

    train_labels - List of labels corresponding with train_set
    example: Suppose I had two reviews, first one was positive and second one was negative.
    Then train_labels := [1, 0]

    dev_set - List of list of words corresponding with each review that we are testing on
              It follows the same format as train_set

    smoothing_parameter - The smoothing parameter you provided with --laplace (1.0 by default)

    pos_prior - positive prior probability (between 0 and 1)
